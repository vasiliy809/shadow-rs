`shadow-rs` is a Windows kernel rootkit written in Rust, demonstrating advanced techniques for kernel manipulation while leveraging Rustâ€™s safety and performance features. This project is intended for educational and research purposes.

## Table of Contents

## Notice

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is under development.

## Features

### Process

- âœ… Hide and unhide processes.
- âœ… Modify process signature levels to handle `Protected Processes (PP)` and `Protected Process Light (PPL)`.
- âœ… Protect processes against termination and memory dumping.
- âœ… Elevate process privileges to SYSTEM, granting full administrative access.
- âœ… Terminate target processes.
- âœ… List all protected and hidden processes.

### Thread

- âœ… Hide and unhide threads.
- âœ… Protect threads from termination or suspension.
- âœ… List all protected and hidden threads

### Driver

- âœ… Hide and unhide kernel-mode drivers.
- âœ… Enumerate all loaded drivers.
- âœ… Enable or disable Driver Signature Enforcement (`DSE`) to allow loading of unsigned drivers.
- âœ… Blocking Driver Loading.

### Callback

- âœ… List registered callbacks for process creation, thread creation, image loading, and registry operations.
- âœ… Remove or restore specific callbacks.
- âœ… List all removed callbacks.

### Misc

- âœ… Capture keystrokes from user input in real-time with kernel-level interception.
- âœ… Disable Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence (`EtwTi`).
- âœ… Cleaning Driver Artifacts from Memory Dumps in Case of BSOD.
- âœ… Compile Encryption String.
- âœ… Support for Reflective Driver Loading.

### User Mode Code Execution

- âœ… Inject shellcode or DLLs into processes using `ZwCreateThreadEx`.
- âœ… Asynchronous Procedure Call (`APC`) injection to execute shellcode or DLLs in alertable threads.
- âœ… Execute shellcode in processes using `Thread Hijacking`.

### Module

- âœ… Hide modules from process memory listings.
- âœ… Enumerate all loaded modules.

### Registry

- âœ… Hide and unhide registry keys and values to prevent detection and manipulation.
- âœ… Apply registry protection to prevent key or value deletion or overwriting.

### Network

- âœ… Hide and unhide network ports from netstat and similar monitoring tools.

## Installation

## Supported Platforms

- âœ… Windows 10 / 11 (x64 only)

## Build Instructions

#### Driver

```cmd
cargo make default --release
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note: The first build must be executed as Administrator. Subsequent builds do not require elevated privileges.

To enable mapping support for tools like kdmapper, compile with:
```cmd
cargo make default --release --features mapper
```

#### Client

```cmd
cargo build --release
```

For compatibility with mapped drivers:
```cmd
cargo build --release --features mapper
```

## Setup Instructions

#### Enable Test Mode or Test Signing Mode

```
bcdedit /set testsigning on
```

#### Create / Start Service

## Debugging

Use Windbg to attach to the kernel and monitor driver activity.

```
bcdedit /debug on
bcdedit /dbgsettings net hostip:<IP> port:<PORT>
```
